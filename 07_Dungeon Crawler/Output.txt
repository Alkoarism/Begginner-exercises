Instructions

You are in a dungeon and need to get to the treasure tagged as "X".
The "." are tiles where you can safely step
On the map, you are tagged as "P" and can move vertically or
horizontally by using the keys as follows:
w = up
s = down
a = left
d = right
Only the first input character will be read.

The other entitys on the game are hostiles,
so if you move towards them or the opposite, you lose.
There are static entitys, called traps tagged as "T" 
and moving ones called enemys, tagged "E" by default.

To stop the game on its current stage input 0
and you will be redirected to the main menu.
