# Begginner-exercises
Some beginner C++ exercises to help me improve my skills on a entertaining way.
The original source where they were proposed is a thread on reddit about C++ exercises for complete beginners.

Some of them can be solved using other languages too so feel free tro check and try them.

The resolution files on this repository where writen using Visual Studio CODE for coding
and Code Blocks for compiling and running all the files properly. This was made with
the intent of making the coding process easier on early stages and to improve my contact
with the language as well as with the IDEÂ´s used with it. On a later stage I intend to start 
using Visual Studio Community.
