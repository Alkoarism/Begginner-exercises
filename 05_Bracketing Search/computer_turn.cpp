//Write a program that calculates a random number from 1 through 100.
//The program then asks the user to guess the number.
//If the user guesses too high or too low then the program should
//output "too high" or "too low" accordingly.
//The program must let the user continue to guess until the user correctly guesses the number.

//â˜… Modify the program to output how many guesses it took
//the user to correctly guess the right number.
